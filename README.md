# EQCluster
An earthquake cluster search software, powered by QT.

### Brief:
EQCluster is designed to take output from [AutoMISD](https://github.com/Fran89/AutoMISD)
and cluster it together into separate distinct clusters using a simple spatio-temporal 
algorithm.

### Compiling:

Use either qmake or QTCreator to compile this software. Tested on the Latest QT5.

### Usage:

  1. Load the file using the menu.
  2. Set search parameters.
  3. Press search for clusters.
  4. Use the Cluster Viewer from the menu to see the different clusters.
  5. Use the save all clusters button to save to a csv.
